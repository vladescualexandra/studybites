# Web app for taking notes during courses/labs

## Goal

To develop a web app that allows students to take notes during courses/labs
 The thinking behind this is that note-taking requires effort. Rather than passively taking information in, the act of encoding the information into words or pictures forms new pathways in the brain, which stores it more firmly in long-term memory. On top of that, having the information stored in a new place gives students the opportunity to revisit it later and reinforce the learning that happened the first time around.

## Description

* The application must allow students to organise their notes by classes they attend and individual study activities.
* The platform is based on a Single Page Application architecture. It will be accessible on a desktop, mobile or tablet browser (depending on user preferences).
* The note editor is easy to use so that the student can take notes during the class. It will implement a markdown sistem to allow simple text formatting.
* The notes can be organised in folders, every folder being a class, there the student can also store the notes from the seminars.

## Minimal functionalities
* First of all --: every student need to login in with their istitutional account.
* Second --: the notes can be shared with other students, a particularity important especially when you have a project with other classmates.
* Third --: the app allow you to add attachments and you have also a section dedicated for tutorials (with the links) with their notes.
* Then --: you can search over the app using keywords as to find everything you need in short time
* --: you can have a private group of classmates where you can share your notes

* As a student I want to be able to login with my institutional account (@stud.ase.ro) to manage my notes.
* As a student I want to be able to view, add, edit and delete notes so that I can better organize information
* As a student I want the option to add attachments (images, documents) to the notes I take so that I can have more details about the subject
* As a student I want to be able to organize notes based on classes, date, labels (tags) and keywords so that I can retrieve information easily 
* As a student I want to be able to share notes with other colleagues 
* As a student I want to be able to integrate content from other sources and take notes (like for example while I listen to a youtube video, i read a book on kindle, attending an online conference)
* As a student I want to be able to organize a study group. I can invite multiple colleagues that will share notes within the group

## Short description about the components 

* We want our app to be easy to use for our customers, therefore we arranged our components in a simple layout:
 
 -on the left side you can find a menu which includes: username, a search bar (you can search within your notes), a 'new' button to add notes or folders, the actual folders and our logo
 
 -on the right side you'll see the folder name, the title, a blank space to insert your note and tools to write however you like.
