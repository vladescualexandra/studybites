# Web app for taking notes during courses/labs

## Goal

To develop a web app that allows students to take notes during courses/labs

## Description

* The application must allow students to organise their notes by classes they attend and individual study activities.
* The platform is based on a Single Page Application architecture. It will be accessible on a desktop, mobile or tablet browser (depending on user preferences).
* The note editor should be easy to use so that the student can take notes during the class. It will implement a markdown sistem to allow simple text formatting.

## Minimal functionalities

* As a student I want to be able to login with my institutional account (@stud.ase.ro) to manage my notes.
* As a student I want to be able to view, add, edit and delete notes so that I can better organize information
* As a student I want the option to add attachments (images, documents) to the notes I take so that I can have more details about the subject
* As a student I want to be able to organize notes based on classes, date, labels (tags) and keywords so that I can retrieve information easily 
* As a student I want to be able to share notes with other colleagues 
* As a student I want to be able to integrate content from other sources and take notes (like for example while I listen to a youtube video, i read a book on kindle, attending an online conference)
* As a student I want to be able to organize a study group. I can invite multiple colleagues that will share notes within the group
